# Operator Mono with Ligature Support

This repository is meant to help you setup Operator Mono with ligature. I went through many various guides to get this working so decided to put this repo up to help others interested in getting this working.

**The fonts found in the font directory already include ligature support.**

## Clone this repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/iammrmehedi/Operator-Mono-Ligature.git

__If you want to build the font yourself then Below is a list where I obtained the fonts and instructions to build them.s__
